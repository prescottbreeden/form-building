/**
 * Goal:
 * yarn test 1/exercise
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   1) Create text inputs for all User fields
 *   2) Submit button that toasts "Success!"
 *   3) Cancel button that clears out the form data
 *
 * Hint: 
 *   - use the `eventNameValue` util in miscellaneous to create partial objects
 *   - `User` type can be found in /types.ts
 *   - there is a hook to tap into a snackbar in `src/useSnackBar.tsx`
 *
 * Ninja Bonus:
 *   1) Add a pet object to our User type with a name and type
 *   2) Create a PetForm and mount it on the UserForm
 *   3) Add a `hasPet` flag to `User` and represent with a checkbox. If `hasPet`
 *      is true, render the PetForm, otherwise remove the PetForm and its values
