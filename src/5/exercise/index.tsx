/**
 * Goal:
 * We are going to try and recreate a simplified version of the 
 * Schedule Delivery Modal in Looker! There are no tests to run 
 * against, this is an challenge for our creativity to think about
 * ways to organize everything we have learned.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * Click on `Schedule delivery...` on a home screen dashboard tile
 * to see all the various tabs and fields. Notice that selecting
 * different options causes different forms to render. To keep it 
 * minimally complex to start, I suggest limiting the destination 
 * options to `Email, Webhook, S3 Bucket, and SFTP`.
 *
 * The biggest challenge out of the gate will be figuring out how
 * to organize the `Recurrence` information.
 *
 * Try not to get hung up on option menus!
 *
 * Use the Select and FieldChips in `src/components` for a simplified
 * onChange interface that matches the onChange props for FieldText
 *
 * Hint:
 * - If you find yourself creating a significant amount of
 *   control flow to your JSX for various fields, try splitting up 
 *   state into more specialized types.
 *
 * - If you are stuck there are some ideas I have left in solution you
 *   can use to help prompt some ideas. Note that the solution is not 
 *   complete and what is there could be cleaned up and organized with
 *   improved typing and form organization.
 *
 * Good Luck!
