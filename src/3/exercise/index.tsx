/**
 * Goal: Solidify exercises 1 and 2 with some higher complexity inputs
 *
 * Note: this is a lead up to exercise 5 and separates the complex Incremental
 * form type from the nested and composed types in exercise 5. Keep this in 
 * mind if you are working along with the docs at go/building-better-forms as 
 * the complex example in the docs is essentially exercise 5, not 3 or 4.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   1) create a User type with Username, Password and Date of Birth
 *   2) validations:
 *      - username and password are required
 *      - username must be alphanumeric
 *      - password must be longer than 6 characters
 *      - dob must be in the past
 *      - dob must be 13 years or older
 *
 * Hints:
 *   1) Use the FieldPassword from `src/components`
 *   2) Use the FieldDate from `src/components`
 *
 * Ninja Bonus:
 *   1) 
 *
 * Good Luck!
